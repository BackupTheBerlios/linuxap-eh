Put the following lines in your /etc/dhcpd.conf:

# WIRELESS STATIONS
    group {
        default-lease-time 14400;
        max-lease-time 86400;
        next-server wsrv.mydomain.dom;
        option routers 10.0.0.1;
        option swap-server 10.0.0.1;
        option tftp-server-name "wsrv.mydomain.dom";
# WIRELESS STATIONS END
    }

This will allow the build script to update with new stations
